##
# Represents a persistent unique identifier for a spectrometer device
# (USB, BLE, TCP, whatever) which should remain valid for connected devices
# in spite of hotplug events around them.
#
# @par Statement of the Problem
#
# Assume we have four WP-785 spectrometers: A, B, C and D.  We connect
# A, B and C, then launch ENLIGHTEN.  A is the first on the USB chain, so
# in a positional listing A would be #1, B is #2, C is #3.
#
# Now we unplug B.  That leaves us with A (1) and C (3).  Except that, 
# positionally C is really now 2.  Now we plug in D.  Is D now 4th on
# the list, or did it slip into the unoccupied 2 slot?  Or was C internally 
# moved back to 2, and now D is 3, but C also thinks it's 3?
#
# One solution would be to UPDATE the positional order in a master list
# on unplug events (detecting B's removal, and changing C from 3 to 2).
# ENLIGHTEN could do that, but note that it would therefore be a client-
# side operation, not within the driver itself.  Or we could move the
# multi-process "Controller" ownership of the several WasatchDeviceWrapper 
# processes into Wasatch.PY, such that Wasatch.PY provided a single-object
# Facade.  We could possibly achieve that by maintaining a list of all
# WasatchDeviceWrapper instances in a static WasatchDeviceWrapper attribute
# (or WasatchDeviceWrappers or WasatchDeviceWrapperFactory as it were).
# But either would require some additional refactoring that I'm not diving
# into right now, although it seems an improved and reasonable architecture.
#
# Or maybe we don't need a DeviceID at all, and just track "the 
# WasatchDeviceWrapper associated with this serial number", and simply
# assume that all spectrometers will have a unique spectrometer (or be
# assigned one at connection).  So maybe my attempt to generate a UNIQUE
# and PERSISTENT DeviceID from the usb.device object is quixotic and
# unnecessary.  That's probably the case.
#
# Part of what drove this is that historically ENLIGHTEN supported a bus_order
# command-line argument which explicitly referenced spectrometers by their
# position on the USB bus.  However, we're now trying to support hotplug
# use-cases, meaning that position is no longer reliable.  But since we had a
# legacy expectation of being able to explicitly identify devices at the bus
# level, I'm trying to retain that capability by habit.  It probably is no
# longer needed, and we can probably replace the old --bus-order option with
# --serial-number instead.
#
# More to the point, the current architecture is such that ENLIGHTEN calls 
# WasatchBus to detect hotplug events, and then ENLIGHTEN instantiates a new 
# WasatchDeviceWrapper to support the new bus device.  That means there really
# ought to be a way to pass the "id" of the device, which was detected by 
# WasatchBus, down into WasatchDeviceWrapper (and hence WasatchDevice and 
# FeatureIdentificationDevice) to be re-instantiated.  I don't trust position,
# I'm not sure how to confirm "claim state" (ASSUMING we wanted the "first 
# eligible unclaimed") , "serial number" seems heavy-handed (and would still 
# require a way to deliberately "skip" already-connected devices, again requiring
# some sort of key).  
#
# ALSO we want to eventually support BLE (which has unique UUID), and perhaps
# TCP/IP (which has IP addresses)...basically I think objects on a "bus" should 
# be uniquely identifiable and addressable from their bus address, WITHOUT making
# guesses based on position or ordering or claim-state or anything like that.
#
# So yeah, I think this is useful.
#
# @par USB
#
# - .vid and .pid are stored as ints
#
# @par BLE
#
# - populates .bleak_ble_device (bleak.BLEDevice from BleakScanner)
# - populates .serial_number
#
# Adding the non-pickleable .bleak_ble_device kind of defeats some of the 
# original intent of this class, as ideally serialized (stringified) DeviceIDs 
# were intended to be passable between processes and "re-instantiated" on the 
# receiving end.
#
# However, now that ENLIGHTEN is multi-threaded (instead of multi-process), we
# don't have to worry about that, and it seems convenient to simply stash a 
# handle to the Bleak Device directly in the DeviceID, where it can be passed
# from DeviceFinderBLE to BLEManager to WasatchDeviceWrapper/WrapperWorker to 
# BLEDevice.
#
# Serial number is tracked in the DeviceID (rather than DiscoveredBLEDevice) 
# because the current DeviceID architecture is to dynamically generate its 
# stringified form, based on internal native types. 
# 
# @see BLEDevice for consolidated BLE docs
#
# @par TCP
#
# - uses .address and .port
#
