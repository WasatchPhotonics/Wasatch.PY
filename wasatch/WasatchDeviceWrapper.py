# Wrap WasatchDevice in a non-blocking interface run in a separate
# thread, using multiprocess.pipes to exchange data (SpectrometerSettings,
# Readings and StatusMessages) for multiprocessing-safe device communications
# and acquisition under Windows and Qt.
#
# @par Lifecycle
#
# From ENLIGHTEN's standpoint (the original Wasatch.PY caller), here's what's going on:
#
# - MainProcess (enlighten.Controller.setup_bus_listener) instantiates a
#   wasatch.WasatchBus (bus) which will be persistent through the application
#   lifetime. setup_bus_listener also creates a QTimer (bus_timer) which will
#   check the USB bus for newly-connected ("hotplug") devices every second or so.
#
# - Controller.tick_bus_listener
#   - does nothing (silently reschedules itself) if any new spectrometers are
#     actively in the process of connecting, because things get hairy if we're
#     trying to enumerate and configure several spectrometers at once
#
#   - calls bus.update(), which will internally instantiate and use a
#     wasatch.DeviceFinderUSB to scan the current USB bus and update its internal
#     list of all Wasatch spectrometers (whether already connected or otherwise)
#
#   - then calls Controller.connect_new() to process the updated device list
#     (including determining whether any new devices are visible, and if so what
#     to do about them)
#
# - Controller.connect_new()
#   - if there is at least one new spectrometer on the device list, pull off that
#     ONE device for connection (don't iterate over multiple new devices...we'll
#     get them on a subsequent bus tick).
#
#   - instantiates a WasatchDeviceWrapper and then calls connect() on it
#   - WasatchDeviceWrapper.connect()
#       - spawns a thread running the continuous_poll() method of the _same_
#         WasatchDeviceWrapper instance
#           - the WDW in the MainProcess then waits (blocks) while waiting for a
#             single SpectrometerSettings object to be returned via a pipe from the
#             child thread.  This doesn't block the GUI, because this whole sequence
#             is occuring in a background tick event on the bus_timer QTimer.
#           - the WDW in the child threadis running continuous_poll()
#               - instantiates a WasatchDevice to access the actual hardware spectrometer
#                 over USB (this object will only ever be referenced within this thread)
#               - then calls WasatchDevice.connect()
#                   - WasatchDevice then instantiates an internal FeatureIdentificationDevice
#                   - WasatchDevice then populates a SpectrometerSettings object based on
#                     the connected device (loading the EEPROM, basic firmware settings etc)
#               - continuous_poll() sends back the single SpectrometerSettings object
#                 to the blocked MainProcess by way of confirmation that a new spectrometer
#                 has successfully connected
#    - Controller.connect_new() then completes the initialization of the spectrometer
#      in the GUI by calling Controller.initialize_new_device(), which adds the spectrometer
#      to Multispec, updates the EEPROMEditor, defaults the TEC controls and so on.
# - In the background, WasatchDeviceWrapper.continuous_poll() continues running, acting as a
#   "free-running mode driver" of the spectrometer, passing down new commands from the
#   enlighten.Controller, and feeding back Readings or StatusMessages when they appear.
#
# @par Shutdown
#
# The whole thing can be shutdown in various ways, using the concept of "poison pill"
# messages which can be flowed either upstream or downstream:
#
# - if a hardware error occurs in the spectrometer thread, it sends a poison
#   pill upstream (a False value where a Reading is expected), then self-destructs
#   (Controller is expected to drop the spectrometer from the GUI)
# - if the GUI is closing, poison-pills (None values where ControlObjects are expected)
#   are sent downstream to each spectrometer thread, telling them to terminate themselves
#
# @par Throughput Considerations
#
# It is important to recognize that continuous_poll() updates the command/response
# pipes at a relatively leisurely interval (currently 20Hz, set in POLLER_WAIT_SEC).
# No matter how short the integration time is (1ms), you're not going to get spectra
# faster than 20 per second through this (as ENLIGHTEN was designed as a real-time
# visualization tool, not a high-speed data collection tool).
#
# Now, if you set ACQUISITION_MODE_KEEP_ALL, then you should still get every
# spectrum (whatever the spectrometer achieved through its scan-rate, potentially
# 220/sec or so) -- but you'll get them in chunks (e.g., scan rate of 220/sec
# polled at 20Hz = 20 chunks of 11 ea).
#
# @par Responsiveness
#
# With regard to the "immediacy" of commands like laser_enable, note that 
# spectrometer threads are internally single-threaded: the continuous_poll()
# function BLOCKS on WasatchDevice.acquire_data(), meaning that even if new
# laser_enable commands get pushed into the downstream command pipe, 
# continuous_poll won't check for them until the end of the current acquisition.
#
# What we'd really like is two threads running in the child, one handling
# acquisitions and most commands, and another handling high-priority events like
# laser_enable.  I'm not sure the pipes are designed for multiple readers, but
# a SEPARATE pipe (or queue) could be setup for high-priority commands, and
# EXCLUSIVELY read by the secondary thread.  That just leaves open the question
# of synchronization on WasatchDevice's USBDevice.
