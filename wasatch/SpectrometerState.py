        # "Detector Gain" is confusing, because Hamamatsu silicon, Hamamatsu 
        # InGaAs, and Sony IMX detectors all treat it differently.  
        #
        # At the moment, all Hamamatsu gain (and offset) is handled through the 
        # EEPROM, as those are not considered to be "user-facing, change-during-
        # measurements" attributes -- they are designed to be pre-set in the 
        # factory and then, for the most part, left alone.  That is to say, we
        # deliberately do NOT provide a friendly on-screen "Gain/Offset" widget 
        # in ENLIGHTEN so the user can just randomly fiddle with gain/offset 
        # values during measurements.
        #
        # Also, Hamamatsu gain is a unitless floating-point (float32) scalar, 
        # which is multiplied into the detector's pixel read-out (AFTER being 
        # digitized by the ADC) within the FPGA.  (Note that a completely 
        # different analog, "hardware" gain is already applied at the board level
        # via op-amps -- the "analog front end" -- BEFORE going into the ADC).  
        #
        # Wasatch spectrometers with Hamamatsu detectors historically use a 
        # default gain of 1.9, but new designs are migrating to a default of 1.0.
        # Software should not make "assumptions" as to what the appropriate
        # gain should be for a given model or detector, but should use the
        # configured value in the EEPROM.
        #
        # IMX gain, on the other hand, is very much a "live" parameter, similar
        # to integration time, which users can adjust and change at any time.
        # Also, IMX gain is an integral value in the range (1, 39) representing
        # an objective gain in decibels (dB).  
        #
        # For space reasons, we still store the "startup" IMX gain in the same 
        # EEPROM field (detector_gain).  We COULD (and have, in the past) use
        # that same EEPROM field for "state", but...that seems hokey and 
        # confusing, especially when there is no intent typically to "write" the
        # currently configured gain to the EEPROM, nor does the current gain dB
        # value necessarily or even likely represent the hardware state of the
        # EEPROM.  So, as with integration time, it is made a fully "stateful"
        # attribute of this class.

        # persist the same information in the same way (providing consistent
